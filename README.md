Visit JLCPCB (https://jlcpcb.com/RAT)

The article is being published in collaboration with JLCPCB. It is one of the most experienced PCB manufacturers with more than a decade in the field of PCB prototype and fabrication, they are committed to meeting the needs of our customers from different industries in terms of quality, delivery, cost-effectiveness and any other demanding requests.

# Introduction

The TMP117 is a high-precision, digital temperature sensor. What makes the TMP117 stand out is its ability to be accurate down to ±0.1°C (from -20°C to 50°C). The measurements can also have a resolution of 0.0078°C! This is great for projects that require more stable temperature readings. There's also additional features that come with the TMP117. Some of these features include offsetting the temperature, entering low-power mode, and averaging the readings.

# Features:
•	Uses I2C interface (Qwiic-enabled)
•	Four selectable addresses
•	0x48 (default), 0x49, 0x4A, 0x4B
•	16-bit resolution, 0.0078°C
•	High accuracy, digital temperature sensor
•	±0.1°C (max) from –20°C to 50°C
•	±0.15°C (max) from –40°C to 70°C
•	±0.2°C (max) from –40°C to 100°C
•	±0.25°C (max) from –55°C to 125°C
•	±0.3°C (max) from –55°C to 150°C
•	Operating temperature range
•	-55°C to +150°C
•	Operating voltage range
•	1.8V to 5.5V
•	Typically 3.3V if using the Qwiic cable
•	Low power consumption
•	3.5µA (1-Hz conversion cycle)
•	150nA (shutdown current)
•	Programmable operating modes
•	Continuous, one-shot, and shutdown
•	Programmable temperature alert limits
•	Selectable averaging for reduced noise
•	Digital offset for system correction
•	NIST traceability


# Ordering the PCBs From JLCPCB
Full Process is shown using Screenshots Step-wise.

Now we have got the PCB design and it’s time to order the PCB’s. For that, you just have to go to JLCPCB, and click on “QUOTE NOW” button.

JLCPCB are also sponsor of this project. JLCPCB (ShenzhenJLC Electronics Co., Ltd.), is the largest PCB prototype enterprise in Chinaand a high-tech manufacturer specializing in quick PCB prototype and small-batch PCB production. You can order a minimum of 5 PCBs for just $2.

To get the PCB manufactured, upload the gerber file you downloaded in the last step. Upload the.zip file or you can also drag and drop the gerber files.

After uploading the zip file, you’ll see a success message at the bottom if the file is successfully uploaded.

You can review the PCB in the Gerber viewer to make sure everything is good. You can view both top and bottom of the PCB. After making sure our PCB looks good, we can now place the order at a reasonable price. You can order 5 PCBs for just $2 but if it’s your first order then you can get 5 PCBs for $2.

To place the order, click on “SAVE TO CART” button. My PCBs took 2 days to get manufactured and arrived within a week using DHL delivery option. PCBs were well packed and the quality was really good.
